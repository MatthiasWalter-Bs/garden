## NVIDIA Partnership & Embodied AI

**DGX Spark Integration** 🔥
- **@darkseed** built a "personal stylist" Reachy Mini that calls an API on the **NVIDIA DGX Spark** running FASHN's open model (fashn-vton-1.5) for virtual try-on while having conversations. Showcased for #NVIDIAGTC #GTC2026
  - "Reachy Mini ✅ DGX Spark ✅ Clothing ✅ Shoes ❌"

**Embodied AI Momentum**
- **@ehudsn** hooked up OpenClaw to a Reachy Mini and described the moment the agent could fix its own code as an "oh shit" moment: *"I absolutely think how we interact with tech is going to fundamentally change over the next 5 years."*
