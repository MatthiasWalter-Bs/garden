## NVIDIA Partnership & Embodied AI

The **Reachy Mini** is prominently featured in NVIDIA's embodied AI push:

- **"NVIDIA brings agents to life with DGX Spark and Reachy Mini"** — The combination of HF models + robotics stacks + DGX Spark infrastructure = real embodied agents. The shift from chatbots to machines that perceive, reason, and act is happening now. *(via @parithy)*

- **DGX Spark + Nemotron Integration** — Developer @npaka123 confirmed Reachy Mini working with DGX Spark and Nemotron, showing practical on-device AI deployment.

- **PrismaX AI** announced support for multiple robots including **Pollen Robotics Reachy 2**, alongside Unitree G1, Ubtech Walker, K-Scale Labs K-Bot, and others. Their philosophy: "arms first, legs later" — manipulation before locomotion.

## Community-Projekte & OpenClaw

- **OpenClaw Connection** — @charles_pow asked the question on everyone's mind: *"Reachy mini + Open Claw = mini AGI?"* Also inquired about ComfyUI skills access for OpenClaw. This is exactly the kind of integration the community is excited about.

- **Chess-Playing Robot** — @RemiFabreRobot (Remi Fabre from Pollen Robotics) built a Reachy Mini that trash-talks chess moves — written entirely with Claude Code in 20 minutes! 🤯

- **Assembly Stories** — @martonsn shared an evening of assembling their Reachy Mini, noting it was "def more fun than arguing about evals" — the DIY spirit is strong.

- **Japanese Community** — Active interest from Japan (@ikkou, @dekisugikun) with users ordering and assembling their Reachy Minis. One user reported a 90-day wait time for delivery!

## Vibe Check

**🔥 Excitement Level: HIGH**

The community is genuinely hyped about Reachy Mini:

- **"I'm totally sold"** — @olpband after watching the YouTube demo
- **"Look how cool this Reachy Mini robot is"** — @TweetingTimo
- **"This mini buddy looks sooo cute... pretty sure we can find cool use cases"** — @albertinisg
- **The list of things I want but can't afford just got one item longer** — @TweetingTimo (relatable!)

**Key Sentiments:**
- 🎯 Developer-friendly and hackable
- 🧠 Perfect platform for embodied AI experiments
- 🤖 "Cute" factor is a major plus
- ⚡ Fast development cycle (20-min chess bot!)
- 🔗 Strong ecosystem building (HF, NVIDIA, PrismaX)

**The Bottom Line:** Reachy Mini is hitting the sweet spot between accessible pricing, open-source philosophy, and serious AI capabilities. The 90-day wait times suggest demand is outstripping supply — a good problem to have.
