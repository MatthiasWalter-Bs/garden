## NVIDIA Partnership & Embodied AI

**🎯 Major Highlight: NVIDIA GTC Golden Ticket Contest**
- Pollen Robotics (by Hugging Face) is an official partner in NVIDIA's GTC Golden Ticket contest
- Contest ends: Sunday, Feb 15 at 11:59 PM
- Prize: Full conference pass, VIP keynote seating, DGX Spark, exclusive NVIDIA HQ happy hour
- Entry: https://pollen-robotics.com/gtc-golden-ticket
- Significance: NVIDIA continuing to bet big on embodied AI and open-source robotics

**NVIDIA DGX Spark Connection**
- Community chatter about Reachy Mini as an ideal companion for the DGX Spark (Project DIGITS)
- DGX Spark + Reachy Mini = "mini AGI" demo potential
- 90-day wait time for DGX Spark still a bottleneck

## Neue Integrationen & Tools

**🔥 Computer Use Agent Integration**
- **Yezhisai** (@yezhisai) built a generalized Computer Use Agent using GPT 5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6
- Connected it to Reachy Mini via voice control
- Demo: Robot calls Lovable, creates a to-do list app, and verifies with vision
- Quote: *"Mind blown that building a custom CUA, assembling a robot and bridging physical robotics to digital agents... can all be done under a week now!"*

**Hardware Exploration for ML Apps**
- Pollen team (Andi Marafioti) exploring ways to let users use their own hardware to build ML applications
- Demo runs locally but crashes if not enough memory — user's machine isn't affected
- Focus: Enabling edge ML on Reachy Mini

**PrismaX Fleet Integration**
- PrismaX AI announced support for multiple robots including:
  - Pollen Robotics Reachy 2
  - Unitree G1, Ubtech Walker
  - K-Scale Labs K-Bot, Boardwalk Robotics Alex
  - Enchanted Tools Mirokai, MIT Mini-Cheetah
- Strategy: "Arms first, legs later" — manipulation before locomotion

## Vibe Check

**Overall Sentiment: 🚀 Bullish & Building**

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Hype Level** | High — GTC partnership elevated visibility |
| **Build Activity** | Active — multiple assembly posts |
| **Integration Momentum** | Strong — CUA, PrismaX, edge ML |
| **Community** | Global (JP/KR/US/EU), very engaged |
| **Frustration Points** | Kit completeness, DGX Spark wait times |

**Key Observations:**
1. **The CUA breakthrough** — Yezhisai's demo shows the "Rome in a day" potential: robots + LLMs + no-code tools = rapid deployment
2. **Japan leading adoption** — Strongest signal density from Japanese builders
3. **Enterprise validation** — NVIDIA partnership is serious credibility
4. **Fracture point** — Incomplete kit delivery (@AGI_CEO) shows supply chain challenges
5. **Next wave** — DGX Spark arrival will likely trigger second adoption surge

**Verdict:** Reachy Mini is the "it" robot for indie AI builders right now. The combination of open-source, Hugging Face backing, and NVIDIA validation creates a powerful ecosystem. Watch for GTC announcements and DGX Spark bundle deals.
