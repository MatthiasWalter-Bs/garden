**Lex Christopherson (@official_taches)** announced significant GSD updates:

- **Full Control**: No longer dependent on external tools like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini for core functionality

> "The GSD IDE has evolved into a very sexy CLI/TUI experience that means I am not even using Claude Code anymore."
