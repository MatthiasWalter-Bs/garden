## 🌍 Community Highlights

### Security Concerns
⚠️ **Important**: Malicious skills discovered masquerading as crypto trading automation tools
- Deliver info-stealing malware to macOS and Windows
- @1Password warning: "AI agent skills are becoming a new attack surface and most teams aren't prepared"
- Skills treated as documentation but can act as installers

### Cost Savings
@skitdetector shared:
- $600/month → $20/month on OpenClaw AI costs
- Switched from Claude Opus to Kimi K2.5
- Same results, 70% savings
- Integrated in 10 minutes

### Multi-Agent Setups
- @KlineCode: Multiple agents coordinating tasks via memory files ("letting multiple AIs work for me")
- @ManishRaanaa: Mission Control UI updates - filters working, task details, dynamic agents

### Hardware Trends
- Mac Mini shortages partially driven by OpenClaw deployments
- @keshavkewlani: "$2K hardware vs $50/month cloud VM? People choose hardware for control anxiety"

### Local LLM Fixes
@hosking80654039: Fixed OpenClaw JSON parsing errors with DeepSeek R1 (the `<think>` tags were breaking everything)

### Growth Stats
@NameCoinNews_: "OpenClaw exploded to 147K stars, igniting a massive agent ecosystem"
