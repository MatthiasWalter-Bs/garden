## Vibe Check

**Overall Sentiment:** 🚀 **Highly Positive & Active**

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Community Activity** | Very high - daily posts about assembly, projects, experiments |
| **Geographic Hotspot** | Japan-leading community (GOROman, Ray_zero3, gosrum, tom_t100ta) |
| **Integration Trend** | Strong focus on LLM integration (Claude, GPT, voice control) |
| **Developer Interest** | MCP modifications, Computer Use Agents, opencode integration |
| **Accessibility** | Sub-$500 price point attracting hobbyists and developers |

**Key Themes:**
1. **Rapid Prototyping** - "built in under a week" becoming normal
2. **Voice + Vision** - Multimodal control is the current frontier
3. **Educational Use Cases** - Strong interest in child education applications
4. **Developer-Friendly** - Open protocols (Zenoh), MCP support, modular design

**⚠️ Watch Points:**
- Some quality control issues reported (incomplete kits)
- Version fragmentation (Lite vs Wireless capability differences)
- Strong weekend assembly activity = hobbyist-driven market
